# NIST produced OSCAL content for NIST Special Publication 800-53

NIST is maintining OSCAL content for multiple revisions of the NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53.

OSCAL XML-, JSON-, and YAML-based content is provided for the following revisions:

- NIST [SP 800-53 Revision 4][sp800-53-rev4] OSCAL catalog and baseline profiles [content][sp800-53-rev4-oscal].
- NIST [SP 800-53 Revision 5][sp800-53-rev5] Final Public Draft (FPD) OSCAL catalog [content][sp800-53-rev5-oscal].

    Note: In the SP 800-53 Revision 5 FPD, the control catalog and control baselines are separated. The control baselines will be published at a future date. When the baselines are published, NIST will provide a corresponding OSCAL profile for each baseline at that time.

    Please refer to the [publication announcement][sp800-53-rev5-announcement] for more information, along with information on providing feedback on the draft.

The OSCAL XML, JSON, and YAML variants are all equivalent in their information content. These variants are provided to support tooling on different format-specific implementation stacks.
